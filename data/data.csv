It's always a good idea to go with what the probabilities tell you even though many times a lot of people don't. So I believe a goalkeeper that follows some credit for being disciplined. Additionally I think a skilled goalkeeper deserves even more credit for going against what the probabilities show and successfully blocking a kick.
